# Object-Oriented Programming

A collection of seven weekly assignments for the Object-Oriented Programming course at OAMK.
The exercises progress from basic C++ syntax to full object‑oriented design, memory management, standard libraries, and Qt programming.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the fundamental concepts of object‑oriented software development
- Use tools that support object‑oriented design and programming
- Apply the basics of the object model and implement custom classes
- Use existing class libraries effectively
- Design programs from multiple perspectives
- Create design diagrams and implement code based on them

## Course Content
- Core OOP concepts: class and object
- Collaboration between objects and different types of object relationships
- OOP principles: encapsulation, information hiding, inheritance, polymorphism
- Using object‑oriented class libraries
- Designing and programming graphical user interfaces

## Weekly Assignments (8 total)
Each assignment focuses on a specific topic and builds toward more advanced object‑oriented design.

# 1. C++ Syntax and Qt Creator Basics
- C++ language fundamentals
- Variables, types, operators
- Basic program structure
- Using Qt Creator as the development environment

# 2. Classes and Objects
- Defining classes
- Creating and using objects
- Member variables and methods
- Constructors and destructors

# 3. Object Collaboration & Inheritance
- Relationships between objects
- Inheritance hierarchies
- Method overriding
- Reuse and extension of behavior

# 4. Object Collaboration & Composition
- Composition (“has‑a” relationships)
- Designing objects that contain other objects
- Ownership and lifetime management

# 5. Memory Management & Pointers
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Raw pointers and references
- Object lifetime and responsibility
- Introduction to smart pointers (if included)

# 6. Standard Library Usage
- STL containers (vector, list, map, etc.)
- Iterators
- Algorithms
- Practical data handling

# 7. Qt Programming Basics + Processes & Threads
- Introduction to Qt framework
- Signals and slots
- Basic GUI components
- Processes and threads
- More advanced Qt programming patterns

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository documents the full progression of the Object‑Oriented Programming course throug eight structured assignments.
It demonstrates growth in C++ syntax, object‑oriented design, memory management, standard library usage, and Qt GUI programming.
